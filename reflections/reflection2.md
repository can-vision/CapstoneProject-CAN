## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We were able to get all of our MVP working, and succesfully deploy our server and front-end.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

The external API that we are using is unstable because the manufacturers are currently migrating servers. Fortunatly, we had all our core functionality working before that crash,
but we started thinking about ways we can pivot if there is another crash.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We finished our goal of having a working MVP, but we wanted to keep polishing it. Overall, we feel satisfied with our work this sprint, but we would have liked to keep polishing it 
during the sprint.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

We don't think we received that many resources to prepare in our sprint planning for the week, it was mostly what we orginally planned when we made our project plan and product backlog.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We believe that no features are "at risk" of not being completed. The only thing that is "at risk" is how stable our external API is since a lot of our features depend on it.
